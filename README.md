# optiver_wand_problem

Optiver posted the following problem some years ago as part of their recruitment process. This notebook provides the solution for a general amount of signals and wands. 

Calvin has to cross several signals when he walks from his home to school. Each of these signals operate independently. They alternate every 80 seconds between green light and red light.At each signal, there is a counter display that tells him how long it will be before the current signal light changes. Calvin has a magic wand which lets him turn a signal from red to green instantaneously. However, this wand comes with limited battery life, so he can use it only for a specified number of times.

What is the expected waiting time if he uses the wand optimally?
